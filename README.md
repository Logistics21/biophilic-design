# Biophilic Design Website (made using Next.js, Vercel, Clerk, & PostgreSQL)

This app was made using the JavaScript library [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It is hosted on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com). It uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for login, [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) as the Database ORM, and [Neon Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) database to persist the data. Lastly, it uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
